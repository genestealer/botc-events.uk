| `group_id`         | Stable ID (lowercase, hyphens). Used for calendar feeds; do not change when renaming the file. Must be unique site-wide. Omit when it matches the filename slug (without `.md`); set explicitly if the stable id must differ from the slug. Required when you list events. |

### Extended Information: Parking

Optionally, you can add parking information under each venue in `locations`. This powers:

- The **Parking information** cards on the club page
- The small map on the right that shows both the venue and the car park
- The walking **View directions** link between car park and venue

Add a `parking` array under a location like this:

```yaml
locations:
  dice-tower-basingstoke:
    name: "Dice Tower Basingstoke"
    address: "London St, Basingstoke RG21 7NY"
    lat: 51.262409339480726
    lng: -1.0850773394547892
    parking:
      # Off-site paid car park
      - onsite: false
        free: false
        name: "Central Car Park"
        address: "Central Short Stay Car Park, Red Lion Ln, Basingstoke RG21 7LX"
        website: "https://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/carparks"
        lat: 51.263485749076025
        lng: -1.0850903424007872
        distance_from_venue_m: 120
      # Example on-site parking
      - onsite: true
        free: true
        notes: >
          Limited on-site parking behind the venue. Please leave the front
          spaces free for customers with access needs.
```

**Parking fields**

- `parking` (array, optional): When present and non-empty, a **Parking information** section is shown for this venue.
- For each item in `parking`:
  - `onsite` (true/false): `true` for on-site parking, `false` for a separate car park.
  - `free` (true/false): Whether parking is free. Drives the green **Free** / orange **Paid** pill.
  - `name` (string, optional for on-site): Name of the car park. On-site entries are labelled “On Site Parking” automatically.
  - `address` (string, recommended): Shown under the heading and used to build the walking directions link.
  - `website` (string, optional): Car park information or booking page.
  - `notes` (markdown string, optional): Extra details – height limits, evening charges, which level to use, etc.
  - `distance_from_venue_m` (number, optional but recommended): Distance from the venue in metres (approximate is fine).
  - `lat` / `lng` (numbers, strongly recommended): Coordinates for the car park. If present (and the venue also has `lat`/`lng`), a small Leaflet map will show both pins and centre the view automatically.

If you only add `name`/`address` (without `lat`/`lng`), the **View directions** link will still work, but the mini map cannot be drawn for that car park.

### 4. Find your coordinates

To get the latitude and longitude for your venue:

1. Go to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
2. Search for your venue's address
3. Right-click on the map and select "Show address"
4. The coordinates will appear in the URL bar (lat and lng)

### 5. Adding a logo

You can add a logo or image for your group:

1. Upload your image to the `source/assets/images/clubs/` folder in the repository (PNG or JPG, ideally square and under 200KB)
2. Set the `image` field in your group file to the filename, e.g. `image: "your-group-logo.png"`

Alternatively, you can use a direct URL to an image hosted elsewhere, e.g. `image: "https://example.com/logo.png"`

### 6. Submit a pull request

Commit your file and [open a pull request](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/pulls). We'll review it and merge it in.

## Updating an Existing Group
